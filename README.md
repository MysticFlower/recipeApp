## Introduction 
I have developed this project as a part of my academics. I never worked with ruby on rails before, I got introduced with ruby on rails as part of a module in software development class.Though, there were many frameworks out there to work with, I chose Ruby on Rails becuse I was really fascinated how the framework works and gems were created. With in **6 weeks** I learned this framework and build this recipe App.

## This application has:
*  Ruby On Rails basics
*  Refactoring: helpers, partials, concerns, design patterns
*  Testing: TDD/BDD (RSpec & Capybara), Factories (Factory Girl)
*  Action Cable
*  Active Job
*  CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery.
*  SendGrid API, PostgreSQL, Heroku.

## This application has complex feature like.
* Ability to post new recipes, and search and categorize them
* Creating recipes under specific categories.
* Sending emails through sendgrid API when a user comments on your recipe.
* I used MySQL for dev and PostgreSQL in production.
* Used Device gem for authentication.
* Deployed this app on Heroku. Link is provided to check.
